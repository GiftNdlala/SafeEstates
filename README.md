# SafeEstates

README for SafeEstates Repo 

1. Overview
This README explains how to adapt the SafeHood codebase for use in gated communities, residential estates, and suburban complexes.
 The suburban version is called SafeEstates and focuses on integrating safety with property management and access control.

2. Key Changes Needed
Below are the core modifications from the township-oriented SafeHood app:
Branding
Change app name in app.json → "name": "SafeEstates".


Update logo and splash screens (assets/images).


UI Adjustments
Remove township-specific copywriting; replace with formal, security-focused language.


Add section for “My Unit” in resident dashboard.


Adjust colors to match premium/gated community branding (white, gold, dark green, navy).


Features to Keep (from SafeHood)
SOS Triggers (volume multi-press, quick tile, persistent notification).


WhatsApp Prefilled Message + Live Map Link.


Background Location During SOS.


Backend SMS Relay.


New Features to Add
Resident Registration Form (name, unit number, contact numbers).


Visitor Pre-Authorisation QR Generator.


Guard Patrol Check-In (QR scan).


Incident Reporting Form (photo, description, location).


Management Announcements Feed.



3. Backend Adjustments
Extend User model to include:


unit_number


complex_id


role (resident, security, manager)


Add Visitor model for pre-authorisations:


visitor_name, vehicle_reg, valid_until, qr_code


Add PatrolCheckpoint model:


name, location, last_checkin_time



4. Deployment Differences
Township app: open access, public sign-up.


SafeEstates: restricted sign-up — invite code or admin approval per complex.



5. Future Add-Ons
CCTV AI motion alerts integration.


Insurance-ready incident logs.


Remote boom gate controls.
